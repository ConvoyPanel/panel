## Debugging via XDebug
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FConvoyPanel%2Fpanel.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FConvoyPanel%2Fpanel?ref=badge_shield)


This method is Docker ONLY. I will not provide any support for non-Docker users.

1. Find your IP address.

#### MacOS
`ipconfig getifaddr en0`

#### Windows WSL
`grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | cut -d ' ' -f2`

#### Debian & Debian-based distributions
`hostname -I | cut -d ' ' -f1`

2. Replace `999.999.999.999` in `XDEBUG_CONFIG="client_host=999.999.999.999 ...` with your IP address

3. Use these guides to configure your IDE

#### PHPStorm Guide 1 (untested)
