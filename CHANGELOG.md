If you are upgrading from v3.8.1-beta, keep note of these notices:

your `servers` and `users` table will be purged. If your routine relies on soft deletes, please make changes now to stop
relying on them as they are removed in this update.

### Changed

- Internally, server details are now passed around the application using Laravel Data by Spatie. Though in v3.x.x, we
  are planning on switching to Data Transfer Objects by Spatie. We pulled the wrong package and didn't realize until one
  month in using the package LOL.
- Virtual machines are now limited to one disk. Multiple disks may be supported when a daemon is available in the
  future.
- The built-in web server is now Caddy instead of Nginx. This provides auto SSL out of the box.

### Known Bugs

- The real-time server installation communication is known to be buggy and will be resolved in v3.x.x
- Editing the server field for IP Addresses will sometime result in the first server of the node to be used. This will
  be resolved in v3.x.x
